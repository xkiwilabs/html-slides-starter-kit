**Option A — Download ZIP (simplest)**
1. Go to the [repository page](https://github.com/xkiwilabs/html-slides-starter-kit)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Click **Download ZIP**
4. Unzip the folder somewhere you can find it (e.g. your Desktop)

**Option B — Fork on GitHub**
1. Click **Fork** at the top-right of the repo page
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/html-slides-starter-kit.git`

## 2. Open the Example Deck

Find the file `index.html` in the folder you just downloaded.

- **Windows:** Right-click → Open with → Google Chrome (or Edge)
- **Mac:** Double-click the file (it opens in your default browser)
- **Linux:** Double-click or run `xdg-open index.html`

You should see a working 6-slide lecture deck. Use the **arrow keys** to navigate between slides.

> **Tip:** Chrome or Edge give the best results. Safari works but some features (like PDF export) are easier in Chrome.

## 3. Make Your First Edit

1. Open `index.html` in any text editor (TextEdit on Mac, Notepad on Windows, or [VS Code](vs-code-setup.md))
2. Find the line that says `Introduction to Research Methods`
3. Change it to your lecture title
4. Save the file (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
5. Go back to your browser and refresh the page (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)

You've just edited your first HTML slide.
