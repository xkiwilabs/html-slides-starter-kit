# VS Code Setup

VS Code is a free code editor that makes editing HTML slides much easier. You don't *need* it — any text editor works — but it gives you syntax highlighting, live preview, and AI assistance.

## 1. Install VS Code

Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it.

## 2. Install the Live Server Extension

Live Server automatically refreshes your browser whenever you save a file — no more manual refreshing.

1. Open VS Code
2. Click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **Live Server** (by Ritwick Dey)
4. Click **Install**

## 3. Open Your Slides Folder

1. In VS Code, go to **File → Open Folder**
2. Select the `html-slides-starter-kit` folder
3. You'll see the file tree in the left sidebar

---

## 4. Start Live Server

1. Open `index.html` in the editor (click it in the sidebar)
2. Right-click anywhere in the file
3. Click **Open with Live Server**
4. Your browser opens with the slide deck — and it auto-refreshes when you save!

> **Tip:** The Live Server button also appears in the bottom-right status bar of VS Code. Click "Go Live" to start it.

## 5. AI Assistance (Optional)

VS Code has built-in AI features and extensions that can help you write and edit HTML:

**GitHub Copilot (built-in)**
- Free with [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/benefits) or a GitHub Pro account
- Provides inline code suggestions as you type
- Has a chat panel for asking questions about your code

**Other AI extensions**
- VS Code's built-in agent mode works with multiple AI providers
- You can use Copilot with different models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
- Extensions like Continue or Cline provide similar AI chat capabilities

To use any of these effectively with your slides, paste in the `css/academic-theme.css` file as context so the AI matches your existing style.
